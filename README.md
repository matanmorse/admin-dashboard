## Lessons learned
This project was for the "Grid" section of The Odin Project HTML/CSS course, so I tried to lean heavily on it for most of the project. Truthfully, I didn't enjoy the style much and mostly 
thought the layout would have been easier with flexbox, however I did discover some use cases for grid that I can bring with me in the future. The dynamic card layout especially would have
been difficult, and I could see some more advanced layouts where I would want to use grid instead of flexbox. Other than that, I felt very confident completing this project, I also got more
experience designing responsive font sizes and using SVG's for icons.
